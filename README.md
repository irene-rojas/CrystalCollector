# unit-4-game
Crystal Collector by Irene Rojas

This is a number matching game created for the George Washington University 2018 Full Stack Coding program. 

It was created with Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap CDN.

Objective: Player is given a target score. Player clicks on the crystals. Each crystal has been randomly assigned a value that changes each time the player wins or loses. The player does not see the crystal's value until it is clicked. The player attempts to press a combination of buttons to reach the target number. If the player wins, the win counter increases and the game resets. If the player goes over the score, the loss counter increases and the game resets. 

I could not get only the targetNumber/userTotal section to reload after a win or loss, so I installed a restart button that reloads the page.
